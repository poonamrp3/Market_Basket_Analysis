Using `TransactionEncoder` from `mlxtend.preprocessing`, we transformed each country's transaction data into a Pandas DataFrame with binary encoding."

    "Next, we applied the FP-Growth algorithm to extract frequent itemsets and association rules for each country's transactions. For a subset of countries, including United Kingdom, France, Germany, and others, we identified frequent itemsets with a minimum support threshold of 0.1, ensuring only the most relevant patterns are included. These frequent itemsets were then sorted by their support values to highlight the most common combinations of items. Additionally, we used the association_rules function to derive meaningful rules, filtering them based on a confidence threshold of 0.8. \n",

These itemsets were then sorted in descending order of support to identify the most common combinations of items. Additionally, we used the association_rules function to extract meaningful rules from the frequent itemsets, applying a minimum confidence threshold of 0.8 to filter the results. "

    "At the final stage of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), \n",
    "the knowledge representation is captured in a graph database, \n",
    "which enables better insight and visualization of the discovered patterns. \n",
    "In this step, we store the association rules discovered by algorithms such as \n",
    "Apriori in a Neo4j graph database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code, a connection to the Neo4j database is established, \n",
    "and a dynamic structure is created for storing countries, \n",
    "association rules (antecedents and consequents), and their relationships, \n",
    "such as `HAS_RULE` and `RESULTS_INTO`. \n",
    "This allows you to represent associations between items (antecedents and consequents) \n",
    "for specific countries with their \n",
    "corresponding support, confidence, and lift values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is visualized using the `networkx` library and the `matplotlib` library, \n",
    "which provides a clear and interactive way \n",
    "to explore the relationships. Each rule is visualized as a directed edge, \n",
    "with the support, confidence, and lift values labeled on the edges, \n",
    "giving a visual overview of the strength and reliability of each rule. \n",
    "This representation helps in understanding the relationships between items in a country \n",
    "and can further be used for different use cases like recommendation systems or market basket analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the core steps involved in the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neo4j Graph Database Connection**: Establishing a connection to a Neo4j database where the rules will be stored.\n",
    "2. **Storing Rules**: The `create_rule` function dynamically creates country nodes, antecedent nodes, and consequent nodes, and links them with relationships such as `HAS_RULE` and `RESULTS_INTO`, with properties for support, confidence, and lift.\n",
    "3. **Visualizing the Graph**: The `visualize_graph` function generates a visual representation of the graph using `networkx`, highlighting the rules between antecedents and consequents.\n",
    "4. **Clearing the Database**: Before creating new rules, the `clear_database` function deletes any existing rules and nodes, ensuring the graph remains up-to-date with the latest rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step completes the KDD pipeline by transforming raw data into actionable insights represented as knowledge in a graph structure, ready for further analysis or decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this is better than traditional storage:\n",
    "- **Efficient Relationship Modeling**: Unlike traditional relational databases, which struggle with complex, many-to-many relationships, Neo4j is optimized for handling and querying connected data. It allows for intuitive representation and querying of relationships, making it easier to uncover hidden patterns and associations between items.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Scalability and Flexibility**: As the data grows, graph databases like Neo4j efficiently scale and adapt to complex structures, without the need for expensive joins or cumbersome relational tables. This flexibility is ideal for dynamic and evolving data, like association rules, where relationships are central to the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features enable faster, more efficient querying and provide deeper insights into the data compared to traditional row-based storage systems.\n"

    "**Steps to explore the graph data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visit the Neo4j Browser** at [this link](https://27f471e5.databases.neo4j.io/browser/).\n",
    "   \n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Wait for 60 seconds** before connecting to the database, or you can log in to [Neo4j Console](https://console.neo4j.io) to ensure that your Aura instance is available and ready to use.\n",

    "4. **Use the following Cypher queries** for each country to view their respective association rule graphs. These queries will return nodes and relationships representing the association rules:\n",
